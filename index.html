<h2>Welcome to WhereAmI!</h2>
<h3>
How to Play:</h3>
The world of WhereAmI follows different rules than the one in which we
live. &nbsp;A straight line between two points is not necessarily
the fastest way there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Each level contains a set of square rooms, which are connected by
doorways. &nbsp;However the rooms cannot be drawn on a map. You may
find yourself in a room where a door leads back to itself.
&nbsp;None of the doors are random, so from a given room the doors
will always go to the same place. &nbsp;In a level, there is only
one room of each color. &nbsp;A block will randomly spawn in each
room. &nbsp;Your goal is to move all of the blocks into the rooms
of the same color.<br>
